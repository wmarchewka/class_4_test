Once rebooted, It is highly recommended to do
an apt-get update and apt-get upgrade to
ensure you are running the latest version of the
kernel and firmware on your Pi, before you
patch it for the 4DPi. After doing this, reboot
once again.
Warning: An upgrade should only be done
after making sure that the latest kernel is
supported by the latest kernel pack from 4D.
Otherwise, installing the 4D kernel pack will
downgrade the kernel.



7) Once rebooted, log into your Raspberry Pi
again, you will need to download and install
the kernel which supports the 4DPi-24-HAT.
The following step requires sudo ‘root’ access.



8) To download and install files, enter the
following commands in terminal/shell /SSH to
download the kernel from the 4D Systems
Server:



$ wget http://www.4dsystems.com.au/downloads/4DPi/All/gen4-hats_4-14-34_v1.1.tar.gz

Install:

sudo tar –xzvf gen4-hats_4-14-34_v1.1.tar.gz –C /
The package automatically selects the kernel
required for Pi1, Pi2 or Pi3 automatically.

sudo tar -xzvf gen4-hats_4-14-34_v1.1.tar.gz -C /

Doing an update/upgrade runs the risk of breaking things as if the version you are upgrading to is a higher kernel version than the patch,
then the display could stop working. The Kernel patch we offer is a patch on the standard release, so it has to match the same kernel version as what your OS is running.
 In some cases, the changes in our patches are compatible with minor releases of the kernel, but it's a bit hit and miss, so if you are upgrading you really need to check what
 the kernel version is you have upgraded to, and then check what version our patch is.
If they are drastically different, then raise a ticket and we will try and get an updated kernel patch as soon as possible, however, we can't constantly do
this for every minor release the Pi Foundation make.
I am not sure this will help you much, but its some background information which is quite important.
