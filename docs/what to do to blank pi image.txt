1. Use BalenaEtcher or similar to mount a default raspberry pi image (Raspian Buster) to an SD card.
2. While in Windows, in the root of the setup directory, place a blank file named ssh.  This will allow ssh access to the pi
3. Attach a keyboard and monitor to the raspberry pi.  Setup the pi on the screen with the correct parameter, timezone, etc
4. In order to get a defualt ip address in the pi we need to modify a file in the pi with a command line.
5. Modify /etc/dhcpcd.conf and modify the lines that allow a staic ip address.
6. Set the ip to 10.0.0.111, the dhcp to 10.0.0.1 and the router to 10.0.0.1
7. Reboot the pi.  You should now be able to ssh into it.
