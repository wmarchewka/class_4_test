SAM 1. You said to add "dtoverlay=spi1-0cs" but that does not work.  Had to add "dtoverlay=spi1-3cs"
OK 2. Since we are using all 3 CS on SPI1 will SPI1_CE1_N (BCM17) be interfered with going to the display?
OK 3. CS8 GOES TO BOTH U25 AND U22.  Is that ok?
OK 4. JP2-1 through JP2-6 is used for what?  (I think they allow 3 differnt current sensors to be used??)
OK 5. What does the U23 sample ?  (U23 samples the current sent to the track coil???)
OK 6. GP0 - GP3 are for switches.  What do they control ?  (I think the switches are built into the rotary encoders but not sure what they
    are to select?  Perhaps they select the value of the encoder?
PROBLEM 7. Display and EEPROM share same I2C. Is that a problem ?
SAM 8. U23 on drawing is should be ACS711ELCTR-25-AB it is labeled as "ACST711ELCTR-25-AB"
OK  9. U26 EN pin not tied high.
10. In decoder.py do we need to set the correct SPI1_CE pin after we set the address?
OK 11. Is the code in the python directory the code to use? what is the code on the root?
    AD9833.py   DigPot.py  FGen_Decoder.py  spiVal.py
OK 12. code_rate.py calls "run_code_rate" script that runs code_rate_gen c binary. Is that still needed?
    was it that python wasn't fast enough?
OK 13. In sig_gen.py line 80 is "LSB = [(freq_regs >> 8) & 0o77, freq_regs & 0xFF]".  Should the 0o77 be
    0x77?
OK 14. In rotary.py I think that the speed and gain calls to the digpot.py and sig_gen.py are reveresed.
OK 15. In the siggen, is the carrier frqency supposed to be controlled by an encoder?  The code does not show that.
    i am assuming that it is controlled by selectable buttons on the screen.???
TODO 16. Are both TACH1 AND TACH 2 USED? What are they specifically for?
MAYBE 17. It would be good to have a physical power button to shutdown the pi so that code could exit cleanly
OK 18. How do we switch between the Primary and Secondary channel (AD704BRMZ)  BCM26 ?
NO 19.  AD9834 or AD9835  would allow switching back and forth via pin selection, while the AD9833 (current) is
    SPI switchable only.  Not sure how deterministic out output waveform is going to be.
NO 20. rpi.GPIO is software controlled i think, thus not very deterministic.  May need to up PIGPIO iu uses DMA
