1. +15V_A GOES TO PWR1 PIN 1 AND NEEDS TO GO TO PWR1 PIN 2.
2. GND_A GOES TO PWR1 PIN2 AND NEEDS TO GO RO PWR1 PIN 1.
3. +15V_B GOES TO PWR2 PIN 1 AND NEEDS TO GO TO PWR2 PIN 2.
4. GND_B GOES TO PW2 PIN2 AND NEEDS TO GO RO PWR2 PIN 1.
5. +15V_C GOES TO PWR3 PIN 1 AND NEEDS TO GO TO PWR3 PIN 2.
6. GND_C GOES TO PWR3 PIN2 AND NEEDS TO GO RO PWR3 PIN 1.
7. R1 WAS 1.5K NEEDS TO BE 20K TO REDUCE GAIN IN PRIMARY CHANNEL.
8. R10 WAS 5.11K NEEDS TO BE 20K TO REDUCE GAIN IN THE SECONDARY CHANNEL.
9. SW3 PIN A AND C NEED SWAPPED.
10. SW4 PIN A AND C NEED SWAPPED.
11. SW5 PIN A AND C NEED SWAPPED.
12. SW6 PIN A AND C NEED SWAPPED.
13. BMC21_SCK1 AND BCM21_SCLK1 BOTH SHOULD POINT AT THE SAME CIRCUIT, BUT THEY ARE NAMED DIFFERENTLY AND DO NOT CONNECT.
14. U27 EEPROM SHARES SAME ADDRESS (0X50) AS THE DISPLAYS EEPROM AND WE ARE USING THE SAME I2C BUS.  NEED
        TO CHANGE THE EEPROM ADDRESS TO SOMETHING ELSE (0X51). THESE I2C PINS (BCM0 AND BCM1) ARE SPECIFICALLY
         DESIGN FOR EEPROM THAT CONFORM TO THE HAT STANDARD.  WE COULD NOT USE THE HAT STANDARD, BECAUSE THE
         LCD ALREADY CONTAINS A HAT EEPROM.
15. NEED TO FIX THE SIZE OF THE PADS FOR Y1, Y2 AND Y3.
16. CHANGED R21 FROM 1K TO 2K TO REDUCE GAIN IN THE SECOND STAGE AMPLIFIER CIRCUIT.
17. R87 WAS REMOVED, UNSURE IF THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE
18. WOULD BE GOOD IF WE COULD SOMEHOW USE THE ENABLE PIN ON U9 DECODER TO SHUT OFF THE OUTPUT OF THE CODE GENERATOR
    CIRCUIT COMPLETELY.  WE HAVVE ONE UNUSED PIN ON THE PI (BCM26) THAT WE COULD USE FOR THIS.
19. PI PIN BCM 27 IS WIRED TO THE DISPLAY AS INTERRUPT FOR THE ONBOARD SWITCHES ON DISPLAY ADAPTER.  SINCE WE ARE NOT
        USING THE DISPLAY ADAPTER , WE COULD RECOUP THIS PIN.
20. DO WE WANT TO USE THE FAULT PIN FROM U23 ? If faulted, the only way to clear fault is to power down.
21. NEED TO ADD BYPASS CAPACITORS TO COUPLE THE OUTPUT OF BOTH U4 AND U8.  WAS GETTING NOISE ON THE OUTPUT SO WE
    ADDED A 680pf BYPASS CAP.  THIS MAY NEED TO CHANGE BECAUSE OF ITEM NUMBER 22.
22. STILL HAVE SOME AMPLITUDE DIFFERENCES WHEN DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES ARE APPLIED IN THE CODERATE CIRCUIT.  THE
    HIGHER FREQUENCIES HAVE A REDUCED SIGNAL VERSUS LOWER FREQUENCIES.
23. DO WE WANT TO HAVE THE PI RUN FROM A CAPACITOR AND A WAY TO DETECT IF POWER IS CUT SO THAT WE CAN SHUT THE PI
    DOWN CORRECTLY?
24. THE CABLE BETWEEN THE BOARD CONNECTOR X8 AND THE DISPLAY MUST HAVE CONTACTS ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE FPC CABLE.
    SOME FPC CABLES HAVE PINS ON OPPOSITE SIDES AND THIS REVERSES THE SIGNALS.
25. HAD A LOT OF NOISE AT THE OUTPUT OF THE CODERATE GENERATOR AT JP3.  ADDED A CAP BETWEEN THE OUTPUT AND GROUND.
26. U11 Q4 OUTPUT IS TIED TO GND.  PRETTY SURE THE OUTPUTS SHOULD BE LEFT FLOATING IF UNUSED.
27. U3 WAS CHANGED FROM A MAX5481EUD+ TO A MAX5483EUD+ BECAUSE IS WAS GVING SOME ODD RESULTS IN THE OUTPUT FROM THE
    FREQUENCY GENERATOR. ITS AMPLITUDE INCREASE AND DECREASE AS THE GAIN INCREASED.
28. Digital pots, we may need to change the length of the shaft, it may be too long .
29. Add solder pads for the digital pots, so that they can be physically connected to board with the mounts.
30. Should we use a reference source for the Hall Effect?  Since the output voltage is critical?
31. U11, PIN 7 VDD is sourced from +3.3V_A.  It should be sourced from +3.3V.
32. Figure out best way to sample current.  It appears Hall Effect sensor only couples the A/C current and does NOT produces a DC that
    can be read by the ADC.
33. More testpoints ?
34. Dave mentioned that the speed signals should be gain adjustable.

POWER SUPPLY BOARD
1. F1 is rated at 3A.  Is that sufficient?
2. Added GND connection on "C" ouptut between PWR4 VIN neg and PWR4 VOUT neg.
